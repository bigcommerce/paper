[![Build Status](https://github.com/bigcommerce/paper/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/bigcommerce/paper) [![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@bigcommerce/stencil-paper.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bigcommerce/stencil-paper)

*stencil-paper* is a plugin for `stencil-cli`. Its duty is to load templates and translations, and call
out to [paper-handlebars](https://github.com/bigcommerce/paper-handlebars) to render pages.

## Usage
Load Paper into your app:
```
const Paper = require('@bigcommerce/stencil-paper');
```

Instatiate paper passing `siteSettings`, `themeSettings`, `assembler`, and an optional `logger` (overriding the default logger):
```
const paper = new Paper(siteSettings, themeSettings, assembler, logger);
```

The `assembler` is the interface that Paper uses to load the templates and translations. This way we can use paper to load the templates
from the file system or any other source. It's just an object that implements two methods: `getTemplates()` & `getTranslations()`:
```
const assembler = {
    getTemplates: (path, processor) => {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            // implement me
            resolve(processor(templates));
        });
    },
    getTranslations: () => {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            // implement me
            resolve(translations);
        });
    }
};
```

Now we can load the theme for the page we want to render:
```
paper.loadTheme(path, 'en').then(() => {
    paper.render(path, context).then(html => {
        reply(html);
    });
});
```
