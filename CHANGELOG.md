## 3.0.0-rc.6 (2018-10-04)
Breaking change:
- Use paper-handlebars 4.0.0, which uses Promises for `render` and `renderString`.
- Change `loadTheme`, `loadTemplates`, `loadTranslations`, `render`, `renderString`,
  and `renderTheme` to be based on Promises rather than callbacks.

## 3.0.0-rc.5 (2018-08-23)
- Bump paper-handlebars to 3.0.3 [#136](https://github.com/bigcommerce/paper/pull/136) which adds support for
  `gtnum` operator in `if` helper.

## 3.0.0-rc.4 (2018-05-31)

  `resourceHints` helper.

## 3.0.0-rc.3 (2018-01-31)
- Bump paper-handlebars to 3.0.1 [#132](https://github.com/bigcommerce/paper/pull/132) which has fixes for
  cdn and stylesheet helpers.

## 3.0.0-rc.2 (2018-01-31)
- Remove access to siteSettings and themeSettings, use accessors instead [#131](https://github.com/bigcommerce/paper/pull/131)

## 3.0.0-rc.1 (2018-01-24)
- Major refactor, moving rendering functionality into paper-handlebars [#130](https://github.com/bigcommerce/paper/pull/130) to
allow for alternate template engines.

v3.0 Contains several breaking changes:
- Removed the direct access of `contentServiceContext` for setting page content. From now on, use `setContent()`
  and `getContent()`.
- Removed direct access of `siteSettings` and `themeSettings`. From now on, use `getSiteSettings()`, `setSiteSettings()`,
  `getThemeSettings()`, and `setThemeSettings()` if you need to get/set these values after calling the constructor.
- Removed `getTemplateProcessor()`. This is an internal concern of `paper-handlebars` and is used by `loadTemplates`.
- Removed `loadTemplatesSync()`. This was only used by helper tests and is no longer needed.
- Removed `handlebars` instance variable. Hopefully nobody is accessing that directly. Any helpers that were accessing
  it have been updated in `paper-handlebars` to use the global context they are given rather than accessing Paper
  directly at all.
- The `translator` attribute has been moved to `paper-handlebars` and is no longer accessible directly on Paper.
- The `decorators` attribute has been moved to `paper-handlebars` and is no longer accessible directly on Paper.
- The `settings` attribute has been renamed to `siteSettings`. This should only be accessed by `paper-handlebars`.
- The `cdnify()` function has been moved into a helper library in `paper-handlebars`.
- The `inject` attribute has been removed. This is storage used by two of the helpers, and the implementation has
  moved to `paper-handlebars`.
